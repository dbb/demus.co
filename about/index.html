  <p>Demus is a small, bootstrapped NPO based in north-central West Virginia. I founded Demus on three principles:</p>
  <p><ul>
      <li>Everyone should have access to a computer, regardless of socio-economic status</li>
      <li>No usable computer should go to waste</li>
      <li>Every child interested in computers should have access to the resources they need to expand their knowledge, inlcuding academic materials and mentors</li>
  </ul>
  <p>In rural areas like this, public computer access is not always an option. Our library has only a handful of available PCs, and some people may need to drive half an hour or more, one way, to get there. However, I know that many of us have working computers that we do not need, or even want, in some cases. I've personally known people who decide that their laptop is too slow, throw it out, and buy a new one. I consider such behavior incredibly wasteful. Thus, it's my goal to "adopt" these surplus machines and donate them to those who do need them.</p>

  <p>I am also dismayed by the lack of computer education in my county. I know that children are taught basical computer literacy and typing skills, but that's the extent of it. My high school didn't even offer a programming class. I feel that this lack of opportunity is detrimental to the field of computer science as a whole. Who knows how many potential computer scientists never were simply because they never had the chance to discover a passion? My hope is that any child who has a keen interest in computers will be exposed to more than just a word processor and a web browser. Perhaps they might want to learn how to assemble a PC or write their own programs. I want to encourage that curiosity, whether by providing programming books or finding a programmer who is willing to tutor prospective students.</p>

  <p>I truly believe in technology as a liberating force in the world, and I want to ensure that no one is deprived of it.</p>

  <p>I am also looking for talented and enthusiastic individuals to join the team&mdash; in both technical and non-technical positions. If you're interested in the specifics, send me an <a href="mailto:contact@demus.co">email</a>.</p>
